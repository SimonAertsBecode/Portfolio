### Just a quick description of my self:

> My name is Simon, I'm 27 years old and I'm originally from Belgium (Brussels to be precise). After graduating in physiotherapy I realised that it wasn't for me, so I did an intensive 11 month training course at BeCode (including internship). Since then, I continue to learn the whole React/Javascript-Typescript ecosystem by myself by working on small projects than can be found in **Project's section** in my portfolio. I've been in the web development univers for about a year and a half now and I love it.

I hope you will like your user experience :D.
