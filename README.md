# My frontend - React portfolio

Hello my name is Simon Aerts and you will find [here](https://portfolio-c9019.web.app/) my Frontend - React portfolio. 

**Please note that:**
  - The responsive version is in developpement, so the website is not supported on smaller screens for now.
  -  I am aware that the layout has still some issues that needs to be fixed.
 - Custom domain name is not set yet.

You might wondering why deploying it if it is not fully finished yet? Well, I thought that despite the fact that it is not perfect it might be interesting for you to see a small aspect of what I can do.

### Just a quick description of my self:

> My name is Simon, I'm 27 years old and I'm originally from Belgium (Brussels to be precise). After graduating in physiotherapy I realised that it wasn't for me, so I did an intensive 11 month training course at BeCode (including internship). Since then, I continue to learn the whole React/Javascript-Typescript ecosystem by myself by working on small projects than can be found in **Project's section** in my portfolio. I've been in the web development univers for about a year and a half now and I love it.

I hope you will like your user experience :D.
