# My frontend - React portfolio

Hello my name is Simon Aerts and you will find here my portfolio.

Please note that it is still in developement but you can nevertheless see the progress here.

### Just a quick description of my self:

> My name is Simon, I'm 27 years old and I'm originally from Belgium (Brussels to be precise). After graduating in physiotherapy I realised that it wasn't for me, so I did an intensive 11 month training course at BeCode (including internship). Since then, I continue to learn the whole React/Javascript-Typescript ecosystem by myself by working on small projects than can be found in **Project's section** in my portfolio. I've been in the web development univers for about a year and a half now and I love it.
